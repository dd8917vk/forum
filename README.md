## My Man Linny

### My Man Linny was an individual experimental project...

1. The idea was...
    - To make the man pages easily searchable in a web framework! 

2. The hurdles were.. 
    - Well a lot actually..
        + I stumbled upon a tarball of man pages..
        + I scraped the man pages with a custom python scraper
        + I used this data to creat the interactive search feature
        + And use it to seed the database with each commands manual page in a django database!
        + CRUD.  Django REST API.  React.  Lots of hours.

3. The results are...
    - Well you can search whatever man page you want
    - You can click on a link to go to the man page text
    - You can save favorites and comments about the commands
    - You can create posts
    - You can delete posts, update posts and read posts.
    - You can Sign up, login, logout, etc.
    - Many more plans to come!

4. See for yourself
